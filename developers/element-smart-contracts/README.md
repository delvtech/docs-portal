# Element Smart Contracts

## Overview

The Element Protocol v1 smart contracts are public and open source. The Protocol’s core contracts can be found in the elf-contracts Github repository [**here.**](https://github.com/element-fi/elf-contracts)\*\*\*\*

As described in our [**Construction Paper**,](https://paper.element.fi/) Element’s architecture is based on native assets \(initially BTC, ETH, USDC, and DAI\) getting deposited into DeFi products which earn some rate of return and have a very low risk of loss. Element issues the user two tokens, one representing the base principal, one representing the variable interest gained over the term period. With Element, there’s a wide degree of composability and different forms of integration are possible. This gives Element the flexibility to support many different products to be built on top of the Protocol.
