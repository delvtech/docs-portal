fixed yield income in the DeFi market. Users can access, via the ecosystem and existing AMMs at a discount without being locked into a term, allowing the exchange of the discounted asset and the base asset at any time. The fixed rate income can be secured with the exchange of any major base asset. The Element protocol does not require trusted intermediaries and allows for fast and efficient trading of fixed and variable yields.\n\n"},"getting-started/faq/":{"url":"getting-started/faq/","title":"FAQ","summary":"The go-to source for all frequently asked questions about Element Finance!","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\nNotice: If you have any questions at all while reading through the FAQ, please join our Element community Discord server! The Element team and community members are always happy to help you understand how Element works and help you answer any questions you may have.\nHow do I get started with Element?\nFirst, you will need an ERC-20 Ethereum wallet, some ETH to pay for transaction fees, and the base asset you would like to deposit. Once you have these things, you can choose to deposit the asset of your liking into the protocol or choose to directly buy the discounted asset of your liking in the secondary market.\nHow does Element work?\nElement Finance enables deposits for users who want to take a variable interest position on a specific asset. The current underlying variable interest strategies are integrated from Yearn strategies. When the user makes a deposit, they may choose from a variety of different lockup terms for their assets. After a user chooses a Term Period, a Principal Token and a Yield Token are minted by the protocol and issued to the user which is redeemable at the chosen Term Period.\nHow is Element useful?\nMany types of users can benefit from using Element Finance. The users who are highly speculative on Variable Yield, the risk-averse users who want a stable form of Fixed Rates, and the Traders who capitalize on the trading markets of these token splits.\nThe highly sophisticated users who want to efficiently allocate their capital towards variable interest can choose to deposit their assets into Element and sell their Principal Tokens to repurpose their capital and increase their exposure to variable interest. This process is called Yield Token Compounding.\\\n\\\nThe risk-averse users can choose to buy discounted assets that are being sold by the speculative users to earn a guaranteed fixed rate yield as the assets reach maturity. Additionally, the risk-averse users can choose to stake their assets into the AMM to earn trading fees.\nThe traders can fill market gaps and inefficiencies by arbitraging the discounted rates as well as the variable rates in the market. Additionally, the traders can arbitrage yields across multiple protocols to keep prices aligned and make a profit.\nGlossary\nFor terms that you are unsure or have questions about, check out our Glossary.\n"},"getting-started/faq/earning-variable-rates.html":{"url":"getting-started/faq/earning-variable-rates.html","title":"Earning Variable Rates","keywords":"","body":"Earning Variable Rates\nHow do I deposit and earn Variable Rates?\nIf you would like to deposit, simply navigate to the Deposit page and choose the Asset, Vault, and Term you would like to deposit into. Once your assets are deposited you will be issued Principal Tokens and Yield Tokens based on your deposited amount. \nHow much will I earn?\nThe amount of variable yield you will earn is based on the average APY of the vault you select for the term period.\nIs there a minimum or maximum amount to deposit?‌\nThere is no minimum or maximum limit. However, when making small deposit amounts, it is important to account for transactional fees and expenses in order to properly calculate expected earnings.\nWhat are Yield Tokens?\nYield Tokens are minted and issued to depositors of the Element protocol when they have selected a term lockup period. The Yield Tokens are redeemable for the variable interest accumulated by the underlying vault strategy during the Term Period.\nWhat are Terms?\nTerms are periods of time that the users choose to have their assets generating variable yield in the Element Protocol.‌\nAlthough the Element Protocol smart contracts allow for any term to be created, it is expected that users and openly available frontends will encourage certain term conventions in order to concentrate liquidity. For example, users may collectively decide to actively support both 3 and 6-month terms released every month and a half. The contracts are open for anyone to integrate or launch a term with. This means the community of users will ultimately decide which terms they would like to support.

The liquid secondary market allows users to enter and exit their term positions at any time. Additionally a user may exit their term by redeeming the Principal or Yield Tokens at maturity.\nWhere does the variable yield come from?\nThe variable interest rate for the current user deposits are sourced from Yearn vault strategies.\n"},"getting-started/faq/buying-fixed-rates.html":{"url":"getting-started/faq/buying-fixed-rates.html","title":"Buying Fixed Rate Assets","keywords":"","body":"Buying Fixed Rate Assets\nHow do I buy fixed rates / discounted assets?\nTo buy fixed rate interest, simply launch the Element platform and click on the Save app. \nWithin this page, you will be given the option to select which discounted asset you would like to buy and start earning a fixed rate interest after making the purchase.\nWhere does the fixed rate come from?\nThe fixed rate comes from a user exiting their principal token position before their term has matured. The willing buyer of that position will purchase the principal token at a discount due to the opportunity cost of waiting out the remainder of the term duration.\nWhat are Principal Tokens?\nPrincipal Tokens are minted and issued to depositors of the Element protocol when they have selected a term lockup period. The Principal Tokens are redeemable 1:1 for their base deposit amount at the end of the Term Period.\nHow much will I earn?\nUsers who purchase principal tokens determine their fixed rate dependent on the discounted rate of the asset at purchase time. Buyers of principal tokens that have yet to reach maturity will be trading at a discount to its underlying represented asset. The further away from maturity, the principal token is, the higher the discount. \nIf a user purchases a 5% discounted principal token redeemable in a 6-month term, it is effectively a 10% fixed rate. Each asset has its own dedicated market of supply and demand along with the priced discounts (fixed rate APY). Note that the fixed rate APY is subject to change from time to time. \nHow do I withdraw?\nTo withdraw your earned fixed rates, at term maturity the user can choose to redeem their principal token at a 1:1 value to the represented asset. If you would like to withdraw early and redeem your earned fixed rate yield before the term's maturity date, you may sell it into the AMM to earn the fixed rate up till that point priced by the secondary market.\n"},"getting-started/faq/providing-liquidity.html":{"url":"getting-started/faq/providing-liquidity.html","title":"Providing Liquidity","keywords":"","body":"Providing Liquidity\nWhat is providing liquidity?\nProviding Liquidity is the process of adding liquidity into an AMM by providing both sides of a trading pair and becoming a Liquidity Provider (LP). Element enables users to be liquidity providers for both Principal and Yield Tokens.\nWhat is the incentive of providing liquidity?\nThe incentive of liquidity providers is that it allows users to earn trading fees on their supplied assets. For users who are buying discounted assets and staking, they will be earning a volatility dampened variable yield and AMM fees for providing liquidity. \nFor users who are minting Principal Tokens and Yield Tokens then providing liquidity with their Principal Tokens, they will be earning variable interest yield (from holding the yield tokens) in addition to AMM fees for providing liquidity.\nHow do I provide liquidity?‌\n To provide liquidity on Element platform, visit this step-by-step walkthrough guide. \nWhat is an AMM?\nAMM stands for an automated market maker.

One token represents the value of the base principal (called the Principal Token), and one token represents the variable interest gained from the yield generating protocol (called the Yield Token).\n\nCreating a Fixed-Rate Market\nThe two token split enables a wider degree of capital efficiency due to the secondary market available to trade these different components.\nIf a user opts to exit out of their base deposit position and maintain exposure to the variable interest earned by that base deposit, they may choose to sell their Principal Tokens in the AMM.\nHowever, because the principal tokens are not redeemable until the term period is over, the principal tokens will naturally trade a discount relative to the underlying asset. The discounted rate, when purchased, determines a fixed rate of return as the principal token eventually converges to a 1:1 value to the underlying asset.\n\nDiscounted assets allow users who are risk-averse to take on a safe guaranteed investment strategy without having to worry about the fluctuations of the variable interest market.\nVariable Interest Flexibility\nWith the Yield Tokens being liquid and tradable, users have the ability to take higher exposure to variable interest. A yield token for a 20% APY on 1 ETH will pay out 0.2 ETH annually. A user can opt to purchase a large sum of yield tokens before maturity and earn the remaining variable interest accrued during that term period.\nBy performing this action, the user facilitates exit liquidity for a seller to recognize their gains in the form of current accumulated yield.\n\nA user who wants to utilize the entire value of their capital towards variable interest, can do so and gain a very high return if the average APY of the vault utilized stays consistent.\n"},"element/principal-tokens/":{"url":"element/principal-tokens/","title":"Principal Tokens","keywords":"","body":"Principal Tokens\nA Principal Token (PT) offers an asset such as BTC, ETH, USDC, or DAI that is locked for a fixed term. At the end of the term, it can be redeemed for its full value.\n.png>)\nFor example, if 10 ETH is used to purchase discounted ETH at a 10% APY for a one-year lockup, 11 eP:ETH or PTs will be issued. Upon expiry of the fixed term, one year later, the 11 eP:ETH is redeemable for 11 ETH. A fixed rate of yield was secured.\nThe locked ETH will always be worth less than readily available ETH. Readily available ETH can be staked in a yield position, gaining active yield. For this lost opportunity, these PTs or locked ETH will be priced at a discount, likely relative to the current yield rates in the market. Purchasing this discounted ETH is akin to securing a fixed rate yield. At the time of purchase, the discount and yield are already known.\nAs a further example, if the current rate for staking ETH is 15% annualized variable yield, a user may sell the PTs at a slightly lower rate. This gives a guaranteed stable yield rate to the purchaser and prevents them from having to shift their assets between DeFi protocols in the situation where the variable yield decreases. Additionally, it allows users to avoid costly transaction fees and other inconvenient complexities.\nAlthough the terminology \"locked\" is used to describe the process of entering a fixed yield position, it is important to note that the Element Protocol is designed to optimize for liquidity allowing users to exit their position at any time, while still enabling users to gain yield until they decide to exit.\nNote: The use of 1-year terms displayed in the above examples is purely for simplicity.

We call this Yield Token Compounding, and it allows users to gain this increased exposure without risk of liquidations.\nFor Traders\nArbitrage without Carry Risk\nTraders with specific trading strategies can profit off the basis point growth of an asset without carry risk.

At the end of a term period, the assets would automatically roll over to the next subsequent set fixed rate position unless the user chooses to withdraw. This provides users with more frequent instances of liquidity should they need the capital.\nPrincipal Protected Products\nElement's principal tokens that trade at a discount create a fixed rate that allows for users to build their custom-tailored principal protected product. In short, this means at the time of purchase, the fixed rate is secured and provides users with the additional capital that can be allocated towards variable interest strategies.

In short, the casual user subsidizes the active DeFi user's strategies by securing a fixed rate yield at a discount on what the DeFi user earns. \nDifferent forces in the market affect the opportunities that present themselves on Element. The active DeFi user’s participation subsidizes the value of the fixed rate yield. Depending on where the fixed and variable rates are in terms of demand, we can explore how these all affect profitability on both sides. Below are various examples of market forces. \nFor an in-depth explanation of the various Market Forces, you can read this section of our Construction Paper.\nIncreased Buying Demand for Fixed Rates\nWhen the buying demand for fixed rates (principal tokens) increase, the discounted market rate begins to lower. This means that users who want to increase their exposure to variable interest will sell less of their total assets in order to attain capital. \nThis makes processes such as Yield Token Compounding even more profitable. \nIncreased Selling Supply for Fixed Rates\nWhen the protocol experiences large amounts of selling demand in the form of principal tokens, the discounted rate increases. This increases the guaranteed fixed rate income a buyer would receive for making the principal token purchase.\nWhen variable interest rate increases in the underlying vault strategy, the acceptable discounted rate of selling fixed rates also increase. The relationship between variable interest and fixed interest is inverse, and Element allows users to effectively short the position of one interest rate to long the other.\nIncreased Use Case of Principal Tokens\nElement's primitives allow for usability that extends beyond fixed and variable rates. Through the development of products and trading, the increased utility of fixed rate-bearing instruments brings trading volume for users to earn higher fees by providing liquidity into the AMMs.\nSummarizing the Market Forces\nThe below diagram provides an overview visualization of all the market forces affecting both Yield and Principal Tokens. It is expected that sophisticated strategies will use knowledge of the various market forces represented in the diagram to realize higher profits.\n.png>)\nAutomated Strategies\nThe following diagram is essentially a state machine diagram that represents the decisions that automated strategies or bots will analyze within the Element Protocol and the respective market forces:\n.png>)\n \n"},"element/providing-liquidity.html":{"url":"element/providing-liquidity.html","title":"Providing Liquidity","keywords":"","body":"Providing Liquidity\nElement's Principal Tokens and Yield Tokens are tradable within the custom Balancer AMMs. A typical liquidity pool holds the principal token paired with it's underlying asset (eP:yETH and ETH).

Introduction (Summary)\nThe Convergent Curve Pool (CCP) is an implementation of an automated market maker (AMM) algorithm that allows two tokens that converge in price to be market-made more efficiently than standard options. Standard market makers either expect prices to change frequently and unpredictably as in Uniswap or Balancer's weighted pool, or they expect the prices to not change over time as in Curve. The CCP market maker works for assets that approach the same price over time and is mathematically in between the current options. The code is an implementation of the Yield space paper with some additional modifications and is designed to be integrated with Balancer V2.\n\nGlossary\n\nAutomated Market Maker (AMM): a trading algorithm that both buys and sells in an asset pair to add liquidity to the market.\nLiquidity: the ability of market participants to quickly purchase or sell an asset on the market.\nSlippage: the difference between hypothetical asset price and the actual price a user gets.\nInvariant: a number that must stay constant or go up when a user makes a trade (eg. x*y in Uniswap)\nCurvature: a mathematical property of a function that refers to how fast a function 'bends' or the rate at which it changes.\n\n2. Contract Details\nKey Functionality \n\nonSwap: This method allows a user to indicate the details of a trade which they would like to make and then indicates the result of this trade. The Balancer V2 vault is responsible for managing the pool balances and trades so will call this method when a user requests a trade and use the output to make the trade on behalf of the pool.\nonPoolJoin/onPoolExit: These functions are called by the Balancer V2 Vault when a liquidity provider wants to join or exit the pool. In onJoin the caller provides the max amounts of tokens they can input and the pool indicates how many are consumed by the call. In onExit the caller provides the minimum output they want to receive and the pool burns enough LP token from them to output that amount. Balancer V2's vault does all of the underlying token management based on the pool's outputs.\ntransfer/approve/transferFrom: The convergent curve pool is an ERC20 which allows the direct transfer of liquidity positions and so contains all standard ERC20 methods.\n\nStorage:\nThe contract stores LP balances and allowances plus other constants to enable ERC20 functionality such as name and symbol. The pool stores the collected trade fees that have not had Element or Balancer Protocol fees assessed. These are used in internal calculations and are stored in an 18 decimal fixed point. Additionally, the pool stores as constants several details of the pool such as the tokens, token decimals, swap fee, unit seconds, and Element percent fee.\n3. Key Mechanisms & Concepts\nThe pool uses the invariant $x^{1-t} + y^{1-t}$ as the trade invariant, where $x, y$ are the reserves and $t$ is the fraction of the period remaining. This formula adjusts the curvature of the trading curve as time flows and so may not support some features of standard AMM curves. Please exercise caution and do thorough mathematical analysis before editing or integrating with unprecedented ways.\nThe pool charges a fee on each swap which is paid to liquidity providers. This fee is equal to some percent of the implied yield if the tokens converge in price. For example, if you buy 110 ether bonds for 100 ether the implied yield is 110 - 100 = 10, if the fee is 10% you get charged X eth as a fee. This fee mechanism keeps the pool slippage low when the assets are closest in price.\nThe trade fees are split between the liquidity providers, the Balancer V2 protocol, and the Element protocol. Both the Balancer V2 and Element protocol fees start at 0% and are bound at 30%. Balancer V2 fees are deducted directly from the pool's holdings, but Element protocol fees are collected to minting LP tokens to an address.\n4. Gotchas (Potential source of user error)\n\nThe unit seconds parameter has complex effects on the pricing curve and should be closely analyzed before deploying a pool.\nAll internal pool calculations are done in 18 point fixed format, but tokens are often in other formats [USDC is 6 decimal, and WBTC is 8]. The storage variables which track collected fees are in 18 point fixed so if loaded and interpreted using the token decimals may be wrong.\nThe pool uses a proportional method for join and exit, so does not support additions of a single token, unlike other Balancer pools.\nIn Balancer V2 arrays of input, values must be provided in order of the numerical order of the token addresses. So users who call join or exit on the pool must also provide their balances in this order.\nFor example: If USDC has address 0x03 and eUSDC has address 0x02, and I wish to deposit 50 USDC and 75 eUSDC I must provide [75, 50] not [50, 75] with my call to join the pool.\n\n\nTo set trade prices the pool uses 'virtual reserve logic' which adds the total supply of LP tokens to the supply of bond tokens before applying the invariant.\n\n5. Failure Modes (Bounds on Operating Conditions & External Risk Factors)\n\nIf the tokens do not converge in the price for any reason by the expiration time the pool will become entirely composed of the token of lesser value. Due to this, the pool can only give a guarantee of security of funds equal to that of the riskiest pool token.\nBalancer V2 controls all LP and user funds in the pool so this contract inherits all of the smart contract risk and the failure modes of the Balancer V2 protocol.\n\n"},"element/element-smart-contracts/custom-balancer-curve/convergent-curve-pool-factory.html":{"url":"element/element-smart-contracts/custom-balancer-curve/convergent-curve-pool-factory.html","title":"Convergent Curve Pool Factory","keywords":"","body":"Convergent Curve Pool Factory\n\nContract Name: ConvergentCurvePoolFactory.sol\nType/Category: Factory\nContract Source: https://github.com/element-fi/elf-contracts/blob/main/contracts/factories/ConvergentPoolFactory.sol\n\n1.

Like these systems, it is a fully on-chain voting architecture that coordinates the process of making permissioned smart contract calls from privileged addresses.\nCouncil contains several architectural choices which make it a distinct new primitive in the decentralized governance space:\n\nCouncil does not have a single security threshold to make a call, instead, various actions can be given different security threshold requirements.\nCouncil abstracts the vote allocation process for assigning voting power away from the actual voting process meaning that multiple complex vote allocation systems can run in parallel in the contracts.\nBy default, Council ships with a Governance Steering Council (GSC) enabled which can be assigned different powers than the core voting system.

Introduction (Summary) \nThe core voting contract allows a voting process for those who have been allocated governance power. It allows them to select which calls are executed from the core voting contract address and does not make assumptions about how the voting power is allocated. Instead, it calls designated contracts that calculate how much voting power a user has for the voting contract. Calls can be executed at a variety of different security thresholds for various different external functionalities. The contracts which calculate votes for the core voting contract are called voting vaults, and the sum of what they indicate for a user at a timestamp is that user's voting power.\n2. Contract Details \nThe core voting allows the proposal of a package of calls to be made from the core voting contract. Each of these calls corresponds to some action on the Ethereum blockchain. Each proposal must be proposed by either an authorized user [Governance steering council] or by someone with sufficient voting power. Then, each of the users who have voting power can cast a vote for, against, or neutral on each proposal. If the proposal gains more votes than a security threshold, the proposal can then be executed after some minimum time, and before an expiration time. An authorized address can change all parameters of the voting contract. In a normal operation, that address is the timelock contract. The core voting contract stores a mapping containing previous proposals organized according to an id associated with each proposal, timelock address, minimum and maximum voting times. Also, the minimum power needed to propose a vote, a mapping that records custom quorums, a default quorum, and a listing of approved voting vaults.\n3. Key Mechanisms & Concepts \nThe voting contract accepts in calldata a list of vaults in which the user may have voting power to calculate the voting power for a user, the core voting contract then checks that each vault in the list is approved, and calls them with the sender's address, timestamp, and optional extra data. The voting vault responds with a number of votes allocated to the user. To create a proposal the creator's voting power is checked and then the proposal is created by assigning the last unused proposal id to the new proposal, and storing its data into the proposals mapping. After the proposal is created, a user can vote on a proposal by indicating the proposal id they would like to vote on. Then, their voting power is calculated, and added to a running tally of the votes for yes, no, or abstain. Votes cannot be made on a proposal after a max time from proposal creation. If a proposal has more votes cast than the quorum threshold for the action/s being taken, and more yes votes than no votes, then the proposal can be executed. Proposal execution will fail if the proposal is past an expiration timestamp.\n4. Gotchas (Potential source of user error) \n\nVotes can be changed or removed by calling the vote function again, with a new ballot to change them, or with an empty set of voting vaults to remove them. \nAll actions in a proposal must succeed or the execution of that proposal will revert. Therefore, any proposal must be created without any calls that have a high probability to revert. \nAnyone can execute the transactions approved by the governance system, therefore, any bundle of transactions made should be vetted to not have exploitable downstream effects if sandwiched by an adversary. \nThe quorum of a bundle of onchain actions is set as the maximum in that bundle, meaning that it should be vetted if the quorum is lowered. For an action it should be secure even if called multiple times in the same transactions or with other low quorum actions.\n\n5. Failure Modes (Bounds on Operating Conditions & External Risk Factors) \n\nSince the voting contract can change its own configuration it can put itself into a position where it is no longer functional by making improper changes to its own variables. There is no recovery mechanism for this format of bricking so the governance contract variable upgrades must be held to the highest security standards. \nThe modular nature of the governance systems is designed to enable upgradeability. In the case of a component like a voting vault fails, it should be voted on to be removed from the governance contract. In a case where the core voting contract is out of date, it can change the core voting contract in the time lock and other permissioned contracts to replace itself.\n\n"},"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/voting-vaults/":{"url":"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/voting-vaults/","title":"Voting Vaults","keywords":"","body":"Voting Vaults\nOverview\nVoting Vaults provide the ability to assign voting power to specific types of tokens/positions. The result is beautiful — governance users can maximize capital efficiency while maintaining the ability to delegate or vote when the time comes. Voting vaults are designed to be upgraded, allowing for voting vault logic to be updated by governance and to avoid the pains that come with governance upgrade migrations.\nThe creation of a voting vault begins with defining a strategy for counting votes / providing voting power. Once the logic has been established, governance will vote to approve the method, and if successful, the integration is complete, and users can start voting.\nThe First Voting Vaults\nThe first voting vault contracts that will allocate voting power in the Element governance system are ones whose mechanisms are familiar to most people who have participated in past or current DAO governance: locking and vesting vaults.\nThe Locking Vault\nThe locking vault allows users to deposit their tokens into a contract in exchange for voting power, which can also be delegated to a different user. The vault tracks the historical voting power of each address and, when asked for voting power, searches the historical record of that address’ voting power at the time when the vote was proposed.\nThe Vesting Vault\nThe vesting vault has the same functionality that the locking vault has, but for vesting. This vault allows locked / vesting positions to still have voting power in the governance system and does so by using a defined multiplier for the vested tokens over unvested.\nFuture Voting Vaults\nIn terms of future voting vaults, once the process for establishing logic for counting votes / providing voting power is complete, governance will vote to approve the method, and if successful, the integration is complete, and users can start voting!\nSome of the possible future voting vaults consist of:\n\nCompound/Aave Vault — use tokens as collateral and/or earn interest while keeping voting power.\nLP Vault — get voting power while providing liquidity.\nOuroboros Vault — deposit Element principal tokens to get more votes than your current balance.\nIdentity Verified Vault — verify your digital identity as a unique person to get voting power.\nL2-L1 Synthesis Vault — L2 posts balance tree hashes and L1 votes using the Merkel balance proof of L2.\n\nIf you have any other creative ideas for future voting vaults, let us know in Discord!\n"},"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/voting-vaults/locking-vault.html":{"url":"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/voting-vaults/locking-vault.html","title":"Locking Vault","keywords":"","body":"Locking Vault\n\nContract Name: LockingVault.sol\nType/Category: Voting Vault/Governance \nContract Source: https://github.com/element-fi/council/blob/main/contracts/vaults/LockingVault.sol\n\n1. Introduction (Summary)\nThe Locking vault is a contract that allows the DAO to allocate votes to the token holders. It works by having the holders of the token deposit them into the Locking Vault. After votes have been allocated to users, they can then delegate votes to other addresses to vote on their behalf. To use their tokens in other contexts, the users must withdraw them from the locking vault.\n2. Contract Details\nKey Functionalities: \n\nUsers can deposit into the locking vault and then either be allocated votes or have their votes be delegated to another address. \nUsers can change which address their votes are delegated to. \nUsers can withdraw their tokens to move them back into their wallets. \nThe core voting contract can query the LockingVault to check the historical voting power of users in it. \n\nStorage Layout: \n\nA system of state which tracks the historical power of addresses using the logic of the History.sol library. \nA mapping that tracks a user's deposited amount and who they have delegated to. \nConfiguration parameters such as the token used and how much voting power history to retain.\n\n3. Key Mechanisms & Concepts\nThe Council DAO framework can allocate votes to multiple sources but cannot employ the Compound governance contracts technique that tracks voting power inside the ERC20 itself. Therefore, for a user to have their voting power recognized, they must deposit into the voting contracts. This contract enables a user to deposit their tokens and receive voting power. When they deposit, they are allowed to select an address that may vote with their voting power. Each address has a historical tracker of voting power indexed by block number, and when they deposit or are delegated to the historical tracker records this. The core voting contract then calls the locking vault to ask how many votes an address has when a user votes on a proposal.\n4. Gotchas (Potential source of user error)\n\nA user can fund another user's account and, on deposit, select the first delegation address. The 'firstDelegation' field in the call after the first call is ignored. \nIf a malicious actor deposits to another user's address before that user deposits, then that malicious actor can select the delegation for the user. If the user deposits, they should confirm they have not been front run and, if they have, they must change delegation. \nVote power queries will revert for users who have never been deposited or delegated to.\n\n5. Failure Modes (Bounds on Operating Conditions & External Risk Factors)\n\nThe Locking Vault contract is intended to be used as the logic contract for an upgradable proxy, and it is recommended that it be only used in this context. \nSince the Locking Vault is upgradable, its funds have the same risk profile as the governance system as a whole. \nIn the case of a bug, the governance system should upgrade the locking proxy to protect user funds. However, because the locking vault is a primary source of funds, certain critical bugs may compromise its ability to do so.\n\n"},"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/voting-vaults/vesting-vault.html":{"url":"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/voting-vaults/vesting-vault.html","title":"Vesting Vault","keywords":"","body":"Vesting Vault\n\nContract Name: VestingVault.sol\nType/Category: Voting Vault/Governance\nContract Source:https://github.com/element-fi/council/blob/main/contracts/vaults/VestingVault.sol\n\n1. Introduction (Summary)\nThe vesting vault contract is used to set up long-term grants for core contributors to the Element ecosystem, but its flexible approach enables it to be used for many other types of grants as well.

Key Mechanisms & Concepts\nThe contract allows a manager to create vesting grants using a balance of tokens that are stored in the contract. Each grant has a non-vesting period, and an optional cliff followed by a linear vesting period. The created grants cannot add up to a total amount more than what is in the contract. Each grant holder can delegate their votes to other addresses, and the contract state keeps a record of historical votes that are compatible with the core voting contract requirements. In addition to a historical voting power record, the contract also stores user grants in a mapping. When a grant is removed for a contributor, any unlocked tokens are transferred to them, and their grant is removed.\n4. Gotchas (Potential source of user error)\n\nThe grant administrator cannot create more outstanding grants than the token which have been deposited. They must use the deposit method for that deposit to be recognized.\nAny tokens or ETH directly transferred to the contract cannot be removed and are locked forever.\n\n5. Failure Modes (Bounds on Operating Conditions & External Risk Factors)\n\nThe vesting vault contract should only be operated as an upgradeable proxy component because the storage library used is intended for that application.\nIn the case of compromise of the grant funding address, all funds in this contract are at risk. And, in the case of compromise of the upgrade system, all funds in this contract are at risk.\n\n"},"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/voting-vaults/governance-steering-council-gsc-vault.html":{"url":"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/voting-vaults/governance-steering-council-gsc-vault.html","title":"Governance Steering Council (GSC) Vault","keywords":"","body":"Governance Steering Council (GSC) Vault\n\nContract Name: GSCVault.sol\nType/Category: Voting Vault/Governance\nContract Source:https://github.com/element-fi/council/blob/main/contracts/vaults/GSCVault.sol\n\n1. Introduction (Summary)\nThe GSC vault enables a different mode of governance than the rest of the voting vaults. It gives one vote to each member of a council. When attached to a core voting contract, it enables the council members to vote on proposals and execute them only with agreement from the council. The council is selected by a continuous election of governance power in another core voting system.\n2. Contract Details\nKey Functionalities:\n\nAllow anyone to join the governance steering council if they prove they meet a minimum voting power in the DAO.\nAllow anyone to kick a member if their voting power falls below a threshold.\nGive each member one vote after they have been on the council for a warmup period.\n\nStorage layout:\n\nA mapping tracks who is a member and when they joined.\nAn upgradable bound on how many votes are needed to join or remain on the council.\nAn upgradable warmup period length.\n\n3. Key Mechanisms & Concepts\nThe Governance Steering Council (GSC) is designed to be a group of people who take on extra responsibility in the DAO and gain extra powers. To join, the members must maintain some minimum amount of voting power in the DAO. The members can vote on issues through a copy of the core voting contract [which is not the same voting contract as in the primary DAO]. To maintain the list of the GSC members, we use a model where the prospective member should prove membership by proving they have enough voting power in the DAO. To remove a member, they are challenged. The voting vaults which initially contained their voting power are queried and, if they have not maintained enough power, they are removed.\n4. Gotchas (Potential source of user error)\n\nIf there is a vault migration where the source of member voting power changes, they have to reprove their membership. This reproof does not cause another idle period before they can vote.\nSince the GSC vaults stores the data of the voting vaults, the member votes and queries them again on kick. The voting vaults of the DAO must enforce that a voting power query that previously didn’t revert does not start reverting. If that happens, members may become un-kickable.\nSome vaults require extra data, for example, to provide a Merkle proof or signature, in order to kick a member who joins using those vaults the kicker must provide valid data as well.\n\n5. Failure Modes (Bounds on Operating Conditions & External Risk Factors)\n\nIn the case of corruption or inaction by the GSC, the DAO can vote to vote on the GSC core voting contract and be given a high number of votes. Meaning that the decisions of the GSC can be overridden by the DAO via vote.\nThis also is a remediation path to many bugs in the GSC vault.\n\n\n\n"},"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/timelock.html":{"url":"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/timelock.html","title":"Timelock","keywords":"","body":"Timelock\n\nContract Name: Timelock.sol\nType/Category: Governance\nContract Source:https://github.com/element-fi/council/blob/main/contracts/features/Timelock.solhttps://github.com/element-fi/council/blob/main/contracts/features/Timelock.sol\n\n1. Introduction (Summary)\nThe timelock is a speed bump for calls. It requires calls to wait for a period before they can be executed. After a call is registered, the call can be removed during the waiting period, and an authorized address can extend the waiting period only once.\n2. Contract Details\n\nThe key functions in the time lock are the ability for an owner to register a call via a 32 byte hashed identifier, to remove the registered call, to allow anyone to run that call after a customizable period of time, and the ability for authorized addresses to add an optional one time delay in addition to the regular delay in the contracts.\nThe state in the timelock is a mapping of registered calls to execution timestamps, authorized addresses, and an address that can register calls.\n\n3. Key Mechanisms & Concepts\nThe timelock is a mechanism to ensure that any security-critical votes that execute a call or bundle of calls have a minimum review time to allow the community to check that the calls have no unintended side effects. After the core voting contract votes something that is high security-critical, a hash of the information of the calls to be executed will be registered with the timelock.\nAfter waiting a minimum amount of time, anyone can call the timelock to execute the call or set of calls. Suppose the proposal is reviewed and an error is identified during the review period. In that case, the core voting contract must vote again to remove the call from the timelock. Because core voting has a minimum vote time, the effective timelock period is the timelock period minus the minimum voting time. To mitigate this, authorized addresses [such as the GSC] can do a one-time per call increase in lock time for a registered call. The time bump should be slightly more than the minimum voting time to enable removal votes.\nThe timelock can upgrade its stored parameters such as the delay time and the amount of bump time by making a call to itself which sets these pieces of information.\n4. Gotchas (Potential source of user error)\n\nCalls registered with the contract must all succeed or the whole bundle will fail.\nCalls cannot re-access the timelock as a reentrancy lock protects it.\nTimelocks should not be used for emergency mitigation functionality and security response functionality, such as pause controls. Because of the slowdown, they may not be able to respond to disclosures of security bugs in time.\n\n5. Failure Modes (Bounds on Operating Conditions & External Risk Factors)\nSince the timelock controls its parameters, the timelock can upgrade itself to a non-functional state by, for instance, making the address that registers calls one which cannot send transactions that register calls or setting the delay to a very large number. Parameter setting should be done with a high amount of care.\n"},"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/treasury.html":{"url":"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/treasury.html","title":"Treasury","keywords":"","body":"Treasury\n\nContract Name: Treasury.sol\nType/Category: Treasury/Governance\nContract Source:https://github.com/element-fi/council/blob/main/contracts/features/Treasury.sol\n\n1. Introduction (Summary)\nThe Treasury contract is an isolated holder of Element governance funds that allows an authorized address to move them. This isolation improves the security of the system and prevents a bug from compounding to total fund loss.\n2.

In this setup, this contract enables small and correspondingly low-security grants to fund non-contentious community-driven projects which are low expenditure.\n4.

Introduction (Summary)\nThis contract allows for grants to be made to contributors of the Element protocol with less overhead than other grant programs. When the grant is allocated, it contains an expiration date, and if not removed before then, it is assumed the grantee did what was expected, and they are allowed to withdraw.\n2.

Key Mechanisms & Concepts\nThe optimistic grants program can be run directly by a DAO-wide governance vote, but it is more likely that it will handle grants allocated by a permissioned group like the GSC. Unlike other grants programs, the optimistic grants smart contract sets a schedule so that, after the grant period is up, the grantee can claim the grant. The default assumption of someone receiving an optimistic grant is that they will perform as the grant would indicate. Only in the case of non-performance, the grant is removed by the funding body.\n4.

Introduction (Summary)\nThe Optimistic Rewards contract is a system for allocating rewards over time without writing new rewards smart contracts. It allows a proposer to propose a new set of rewards and then, after a review period, it is made official. During the review period, governance can reject the proposed rewards.\nThe name optimistic comes from the fact that the mechanism is a play on an optimistic rollup, where the fraud proofs are governance votes but, instead of L2 transactions, the updates are new rewards balances.\n2. Contract Details\nKey Functionalities:\n\nThe ability for addresses who have confirmed rewards to claim those rewards, or to claim them and then move them into the DAO to continue voting.\nThe ability for addresses who have confirmed rewards but have not claimed them to vote using them as votes.\nA proposer can propose a new Merkle root encoding rewards.\nGovernance can reject a new Merkle root encoding rewards.\n\nStorage layout:\n\nA Merkle root containing confirmed rewards.\nA mapping of how many rewards each address has claimed.\nA proposed root and when it was proposed.\nA challenge period length.\n\n3. Key Mechanisms & Concepts\nRewards systems voted in DAOs are often complex mathematical formulas on how much incentive to give to taking actions in the protocol. Each of these mechanisms must often be encoded into smart contracts. Given the security risk of smart contracts and implementation complexity, this naturally limits what can be done with rewards, how complex they are, and how fast they can change or be implemented. The optimistic rewards paradigm is a way to move rewards calculation off-chain and alleviate those limitations. To accomplish this, a proposer address is selected by governance. The proposer runs a deterministic program that calculates rewards, and then submits this on-chain for review. Community members also run the rewards program and, if fraud is detected, they can submit a DAO vote to remove the proposer and block the rewards. Given an active community, there is no incentive for a malicious proposer to submit rewards.\n4. Gotchas (Potential source of user error)\n\nRewards Merkle roots must contain unique accounts, they must be append-only, and the accounts must only increase in rewards allocated. The root tracks the total all-time rewards granted.\n\n5. Failure Modes (Bounds on Operating Conditions & External Risk Factors)\n\nAn engaged community of verifiers of rewards is required for this system to work. The DAO should consider allocating rewards to chain watchers to encourage this.\nThe total tokens in this contract should be limited so that, if a bug or hack occurs, the risk is mitigated.\n\n"},"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/simple-proxy.html":{"url":"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/simple-proxy.html","title":"Simple Proxy","keywords":"","body":"Simple Proxy\n\nContract Name: SimpleProxy.sol\nType/Category: Proxy\nContract Source: https://github.com/element-fi/council/blob/main/contracts/simpleProxy.sol\n\n1. Introduction (Summary)\nThe simple proxy is used to make a contract upgradeable by splitting the state from the logic run by the smart contract. It is implemented in gas-efficient assembly and calls a changeable logic contract that runs the code in that contract using the storage of the proxy.\n2. Contract Details\nThe key functionalities of the smart contract are the ability to accept calls from users and run the code of another contract as if they had called it, and the ability to change which contract's logic is used. The simple proxy stores the address of the implementation and the address allowed to upgrade that implementation.\n3. Key Mechanisms & Concepts\nThe simple proxy's fallback function will take the data provided by the caller and forward that data as a delegate call to the implementation address, then propagate any return or error back to the caller. The fallback uses optimized assembly to achieve this efficiently. Since the proxy uses delegate call, the address of the proxy will have any state changes made in it, instead of in the address of the implementation. Therefore, if the implementation is changed, the new implementation will have access to the same storage. The only other function in the proxy allows a governance address to change the implementation address, which is called when the callback function executes.\n4. Gotchas (Potential source of user error)\n\nThe governance and implementation address is normally stored in the contract so any logic contract must use the storage library to manage storage or will almost certainly corrupt storage.\nFunction names 'upgradeProxy(address)' 'resetProxyOwner(address)' and their corresponding selectors cannot be used in logic contracts and are reserved for the proxy.\n\n5. Failure Modes (Bounds on Operating Conditions & External Risk Factors)\n\nThe governance address can make any change to the storage or usage of the proxy; therefore, upgradable contracts are only as secure as their governance mechanism. If governance is corrupted the whole contract is also corrupted.\n\n"},"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/storage.html":{"url":"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/storage.html","title":"Storage","keywords":"","body":"Storage\n\nContract Name: Storage.sol\nType/Category: Library\nContract Source:https://github.com/element-fi/council/blob/main/contracts/libraries/Storage.sol\n\n1. Introduction (Summary)\nThe Storage library is a utility library designed to be used with the simple proxy(link). As a library, it is inherited and extended by all of the logic contracts for proxies.\n2. Contract Details\nThere is a set of functions that allow the reading and setting of variables for every type of contract, indexed by their names.  The name and type are hashed together to produce a unique storage location and then assembly is used to set the location of a returned storage structure. For low-level types [address, uintX, bytesX] assembly does not have access to the slot, and custom structs [Addresses, UintX, BytesX] are returned instead. The library also contains custom structs for commonly used packing pairs [(uint128, uint128), (uint96, address)]. As a library, it does not have any storage itself, and only contains the ability to help other contracts layout their storage.\n3. Key Mechanisms & Concepts\n\nUpgradable proxies in Solidity are harder to use securely because the Solidity compiler gives each storage variable a fixed slot in storage, based on declaration order in the source code. This is why special care must be taken to avoid storage corruption on upgrades.\nThis storage library is a way around that uses a hash of the variable name and variable type to assign storage locations, meaning they can be easily accessed across upgrades. They are also much harder to corrupt.\n\n4. Gotchas (Potential source of user error)\n\nTwo variables of different types may share the same name, and so when loaded with different type functions, load different locations. Nevertheless, we do not encourage using two variables with the same name as it is bad practice.\nDue to the custom storage layout, other storage libraries should not be assumed to work with this library. We heavily discourage the usage of normal storage management and especially storage assembly simultaneously as this library.\nDo not allow external access to inputs that are provided as variable names when calling this library. We strongly encourage all variable names to be constant strings set on compile.\nDue to the pointer system of this contract memory, corruption can cause storage corruption. We strongly discourage interacting with memory assembly in conjunction with this contract and recommend modern versions of solidity.\nWhen using this library we recommend the code to be audited by an auditor with extensive low-level EVM experience.\n\n5. Failure Modes (Bounds on Operating Conditions & External Risk Factors)\n\nThis contract can cause storage corruption if not used securely or due to cascading failures in other places.\n\n"},"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/history.html":{"url":"governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/history.html","title":"History","keywords":"","body":"History\n\nContract Name: History.sol\nType/Category: Library\nContract Source:https://github.com/element-fi/council/blob/main/contracts/libraries/History.sol\n\n1. Introduction (Summary)\nThe History library is an optimized data structure that uses the custom storage layout of our proxy architecture to store historical block indexed data for an address. It is used to track delegation in the Locking Vault, Vesting Vault, and potentially future voting vaults.\n2. Contract Details\nThe History library allows mapping from addresses to arrays containing historical data based on a name. This follows the pattern of the custom storage library for proxy storage. When data is added for a user, it is appended to the end of their stored data. Calls to 'find' or 'findAndClear' do a binary search over the stored historical data to return data at the greatest block number less than or equal to the queried one. The 'findAndClear' call also deletes data with block numbers older than some threshold.\nSince this contract is a library, it does not hold any storage. Still, it allows a caller to define a storage mapping, which is a mapping from an address to a custom encoded historical data array.\n3. Key Mechanisms & Concepts\nThe voting vault delegation and voting system need the past state of the voting power at the start of the voting period; this library helps get that. Each voting vault that uses delegation inherits from this library and uses its internal methods when called by governance to lookup the past voting power of each user.\n4. Gotchas (Potential source of user error)\n\nLookups revert on the access of uninitialized data. Contracts should not depend on zero return for users who have never had voting power added.\nLike the storage library, this library has direct access to storage and the possibility to corrupt storage. We recommend very high caution using this in combination with another assembly.\nIf the voting vault must select a stale data-bound greater than the data it looks up, 'findAndClear' can cause reverts.\n\n5. Failure Modes (Bounds on Operating Conditions & External Risk Factors)\n\nIf a delegatee gains more than a very high threshold of entries, they may pass a threshold where calling 'findAndClear' for them will cost more gas than the block limit. This is highly unlikely and can be mitigated by the user withdrawing.\n\n"}}}
