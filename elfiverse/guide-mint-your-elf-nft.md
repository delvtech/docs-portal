# Guide: Mint Your ELF NFT



With the launch of the ELFI token and the Element DAO, Element Finance has now released the Elfiverse NFT collection as a gift to the community. If you made it into the minting whitelist, read on to learn how to mint yours!

### Who can mint?

The first minting phase went live on April 6th, 2022. The first 4,700 protocol users to have claimed and delegated their ELFI token airdrop were included into the whitelist and are eligible to mint.

We'll release more details about subsequent minting phases for the remaining 5,300 NFTs further down the line.
