## Delegation Page

![](../../.gitbook/assets/guides/delegation_1.jpeg)
You can view who you’re currently delegating to, alongside a library of delegates. 

To view proposals that are open for voting, click on the ‘Active’ toggle button on the top right-hand side of the page. You can now select the desired proposal and ‘Proposal Description,’ and view both a link to the proposal on Snapshot and a link to the proposal discussion on the forum in Commonwealth. 

You can view your personal voting power (including what others have delegated to you) in relation to a given proposal and how many more votes are required for the proposal to reach quorum, the minimum number of votes required to ratify a proposal.
