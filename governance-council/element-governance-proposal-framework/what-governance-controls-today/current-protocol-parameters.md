# Current Protocol Parameters

### **Collecting and Setting Fee Rates:**

Changing Protocol trade fees, collecting affiliate fees from partner protocols such as Yearn, and more.

* **For example,** currently, Protocol trade fees are split between the liquidity providers, the Balancer V2 protocol, and the Element Protocol. Both the Balancer V2 and Element Protocol fees start at 0% and are bound at 30%. Balancer V2 fees are deducted directly from the pool's holdings, but Element protocol fees must be collected to an address (possibly to the GSC or to the Element DAO treasury depending on what governance decides). Governance has the ability to increase or decrease the trading fee structure.

### **Protocol Upgrades:**&#x20;

Should the Element DAO governance community decide to upgrade the Element Protocol, it will go through governance. These types of changes will go through the process defined for Protocol Proposals.
