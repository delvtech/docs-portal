# Guidelines of the Element Governance Proposal Framework (EGPF)

### 1. **Explicitness**

A proposal should clearly define and address a specific behavior or single responsibility. If it proposes multiple actions, it should be split into multiple explicit proposals.

### **2. Completeness**

A proposal should be thorough. Relevant particulars should not be left undefined or unreferenced.

### **3. Avoid overlap**

Multiple independent proposals should not propose the implementation of the same type of behavior. Review active proposals to avoid overlap.

### **4. Clarity**

A proposal should be as clear and as easy to understand as possible. Be succinct, use simple language, and consider having a peer in the community review prior to submission.
