## Discord ZK Claim Flow

This guide is for **Community contributors**. To see if you are eligible, please review our post on distribution. Community contributors are users who engaged in meaningful conversations in our Discord community.

### How to claim my Discord-based airdrop?

1. Go to the [Discord Airdrop Dashboard](https://gov.element.fi/zk/discord/).

2. Make sure you read the instructions on:

	* How to Generate your Key, Secret, & Public ID 
	* How to Share your New Public ID on Discord
	* How to Check your Eligibility

3. After reading the instructions and ensuring that your wallet is connected, click on **Get Started** on the bottom right-hand side.

4. **Click and drag** the slider in any direction until the progress bar turns green. This will generate a random Key and Secret,based on your trackpad (or mouse) movements. Once ready, click on **Download JSON**. Make sure that you save the JSON file in a secure location. You will need both your Key and Secret to check if your Discord ID was eligible.

7. **Paste** the Discord Command you have copied into the Discord-Claim channel in the Element Discord server. 

    Make sure that you see the /submitpublicid message on the screen. This means that the bot has recognized the command. Finally, **press the enter (or return) key** on your keyboard.
