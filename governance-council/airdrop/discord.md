* Make sure you read the instructions on:
  * How to Generate your Key, Secret, & Public ID

* **Click and drag** the slider in any direction until the progress bar turns green. This will generate a random Key and Secret,based on your trackpad (or mouse) movements. Once ready, click on **Download JSON**. Make sure that you save the JSON file in a secure location. You will need both your Key and Secret to check if your Discord ID was eligible.

*   **Paste** the Discord Command you have copied into the Discord-Claim channel in the Element Discord server.

    Make sure that you see the /submitpublicid message on the screen. This means that the bot has recognized the command. Finally, **press the enter (or return) key** on your keyboard.
