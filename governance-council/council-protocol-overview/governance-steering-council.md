# Governance Steering Council

## What is the Governance Steering Council (GSC)?

The GSC is a group of delegates, each of whom has reached a pre-established threshold of delegated voting power, giving them additional governance powers within the system, and as a result, additional responsibilities.

GSC members can have different special functions (propose votes directly on chain, spend a portion of treasury funds at their discretion, etc.), different responsibilities (DAO2DAO relationships, collaborations, treasury management, community engagement, etc.), and might (depending upon a vote) be compensated for the time and effort that they dedicate to improving the protocol. All of these functions and responsibilities must be defined and ratified through the governance process.
