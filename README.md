Element Finance is a protocol that enables users to seek high fixed yield income in the DeFi market. Users can access, via the ecosystem and existing AMMs at a discount without being locked into a term, allowing the exchange of the discounted asset and the [base asset](https://github.com/element-fi/construction-paper/blob/3e60e1bcd6276ec2dcd8888abb5423c37f4f9282/Construction-Paper.md#14-glossary-definitions) at any time. The fixed rate income can be secured with the exchange of any major base asset. The Element protocol does not require trusted intermediaries and allows for fast and efficient trading of fixed and variable yields.
