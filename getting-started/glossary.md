      <td style="text-align:left">The number of PTs staked in a pool pairing of the base asset and the PT.

        <p></p>
        <p>Annual Percentage Yield is a time-based measurement of the Return On Investment
          (ROI) on an asset.</p>

          <li>For example, $100 invested at 5% APY would yield $105 after one year,
            if there is no compounding of any yield earned on that $100 through the
            year. Assuming a static APY rate, the Monthly ROI would be 0.41%.</li>

        between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet. It occurs
        when the price of the tokens inside an AMM diverges in any direction. The
