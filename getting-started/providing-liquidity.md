## What is the incentive of providing liquidity?

The incentive of liquidity providers is that it allows users to earn trading fees on their supplied assets. For users who are buying discounted assets and staking, they will be earning a volatility dampened variable yield and AMM fees for providing liquidity.&#x20;

For users who are minting Principal Tokens and then providing liquidity with their Principal Tokens, they will be earning variable interest yield (from holding the yield tokens) in addition to AMM fees for providing liquidity.

The AMM that Element uses is a decentralized AMM called [**Balancer**](https://balancer.finance/) and has been optimized to handle Element's principal tokens.&#x20;
